👋 Hi, I am Abdullah Asif

📍Based in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah 
💻 Junior Python Developer

I'm a Junior Python Developer and Computer Science student at Arab Open University (Jeddah), passionate about building real-world tech solutions through code. I love working on backend projects, building web apps with Flask, automating boring stuff with Python, and exploring data with Pandas & Tableau.

🧠 Always learning — currently diving deeper into REST APIs, AI prompt engineering, and data-driven applications.
