👋 Hi, I am Abdullah Asif

📍Based in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah 
💻 Junior Python Developer

I'm a Junior Python Developer and Computer Science student at Arab Open University (Jeddah), passionate about building real-world tech solutions through code. I love working on backend projects, building web apps with Flask, automating boring stuff with Python, and exploring data with Pandas & Tableau.

🧠 Always learning — currently diving deeper into REST APIs, AI prompt engineering, and data-driven applications.

🔧 Tech I work with:
- **Python** (automation, web scraping, GUI, Flask)
- **Flask + HTML/CSS + WTForms + SQLAlchemy**
- **Data Analysis** (Pandas, Tableau, Google Sheets)
- **Web scraping** (Amazon, LinkedIn, Tinder, etc.)
- **Login/auth systems**, custom APIs, and dashboards
